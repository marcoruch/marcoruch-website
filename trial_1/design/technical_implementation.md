# Technical Implementation Strategy

## Technology Stack Selection

### Frontend Framework
**Recommendation: React.js with Next.js**

**Rationale:**
- **Performance**: Server-side rendering capabilities for optimal loading performance
- **Developer Experience**: Modern development workflow with excellent component architecture
- **SEO Optimization**: Critical for recruiter discoverability
- **Image Optimization**: Built-in features for the premium visual design requirements
- **Routing**: Clean URL structure without hash-based navigation

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Pure HTML/CSS/JS**: Would limit component reusability and modern features
- **Angular**: While Marco has expertise in Angular, the specific needs of this portfolio benefit from Next.js's built-in features
- **Vue.js**: Strong contender but less widespread adoption in enterprise recruitment

### CSS Approach
**Recommendation: Styled Components with global theme provider**

**Rationale:**
- **Component Encapsulation**: Styles scoped to components for maintainability
- **Theme Management**: Centralized color and design token management
- **Dynamic Styling**: Easily implement state-based styling changes
- **Performance**: CSS-in-JS with optimized runtime performance
- **Developer Experience**: Familiar syntax with added component benefits

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **CSS Modules**: Good isolation but less dynamic capability
- **Tailwind CSS**: Rapid development but potentially verbose markup
- **SCSS**: Powerful but lacks component encapsulation

### Animation Library
**Recommendation: Framer Motion**

**Rationale:**
- **Declarative API**: Clean implementation of complex animations
- **Performance**: Hardware-accelerated animations with minimal performance impact
- **Gesture Support**: Advanced interaction capabilities
- **Exit Animations**: Support for elements leaving the DOM
- **Accessibility**: Built-in reduced motion support

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **GSAP**: Powerful but more imperative approach
- **CSS Animations**: Limited for complex sequences
- **React Spring**: Strong physics-based animations but steeper learning curve

### State Management
**Recommendation: React Context API with hooks**

**Rationale:**
- **Appropriate Scale**: Portfolio site has limited global state requirements
- **Simplicity**: Avoids unnecessary complexity for the scope
- **Performance**: Sufficient for the portfolio's needs
- **Developer Experience**: Native React solution

**Alternatives Considered:**
- **Redux**: Overkill for this application size
- **MobX**: More complex than needed
- **Recoil**: Newer with less widespread adoption

- Alternative text for all non-text content
- Live regions for dynamic content updates
- Tested with VoiceOver and NVDA

### Reduced Motion Implementation
- prefers-reduced-motion media query support
- Alternative static presentations for animations
- Essential motion only when reduced motion is preferred
- Appropriate animation speed adjustments

## Code Organization and Architecture
