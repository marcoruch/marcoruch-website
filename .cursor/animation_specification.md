# Animation and Interaction Design Specification

## Animation Philosophy

### Guiding Principles

1. **Purpose-Driven**: Every animation serves a specific purpose—guiding attention, providing feedback, or enhancing brand perception
2. **Subtle Sophistication**: Animations reflect the "expensive materialistic" aesthetic through refinement and restraint
3. **Performance-Conscious**: All animations are optimized for smooth performance across devices
4. **Hierarchy-Reinforcing**: Motion design emphasizes the content hierarchy and guides the user journey
5. **Brand-Consistent**: Animation timing, easing, and style reinforce the premium, modern art aesthetic

### Animation Character

- **Tempo**: Deliberate and measured (never rushed)
- **Precision**: Clean, decisive movements without bounce or excessive flourish
- **Weight**: Suggesting substance and quality through timing and easing
- **Restraint**: Favoring subtlety over showiness
- **Intention**: Every movement appears purposeful and considered

## Global Motion Parameters

### Timing Guidelines

| Animation Type | Duration | Easing |
|----------------|----------|--------|
| Micro-interactions (hover, focus) | 200-300ms | cubic-bezier(0.25, 0.1, 0.25, 1) |
| Transitions (page, section) | 400-600ms | cubic-bezier(0.19, 1, 0.22, 1) |
| Reveals (content, sections) | 600-800ms | cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1) |
| Background effects | 800-1200ms | cubic-bezier(0.33, 1, 0.68, 1) |

### Motion Scale

| Property | Small | Medium | Large |
|----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Translation | 4-8px | 12-24px | 30-60px |
| Scale | 1.02-1.05 | 1.05-1.1 | 1.1-1.2 |
| Opacity | 0.9-1 | 0.7-1 | 0.4-1 |
| Rotation | 1-3° | 5-10° | 15-45° |

### Stagger Timing

## Technical Implementation Considerations

### Performance Optimization

#### Animation Properties
- Prefer opacity and transform properties (translate, scale, rotate)
- Avoid animating properties that trigger layout (width, height, top, left)
- Use will-change sparingly and strategically
- Implement throttling for scroll-based animations

#### Resource Management
- Lazy-initialize off-screen animations
- Clean up animation listeners when not needed
- Use requestAnimationFrame for custom animations
- Implement intersection observer for scroll triggers

### Accessibility Considerations

#### Reduced Motion Preferences
```css
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  /* Simplified animations */
}
```

#### Essential vs. Decorative Animations
- Functional animations remain at reduced speed
- Decorative animations disabled with reduced motion preference
- Ensure all content is accessible without animation

#### Animation Timing
- Avoid rapid flashing (3Hz or faster)
- Provide sufficient time for reading before transitions
- Allow user control over animation speed where appropriate

### Cross-Browser Implementation

#### Standard Implementations
- CSS Transitions for simple state changes
- CSS Animations for repeating/complex animations
- Web Animations API for programmatic control
- RequestAnimationFrame for custom animations

#### Fallback Strategies
- Feature detection for animation capabilities
- Static alternatives for unsupported features
- Graceful degradation approach

## Animation Documentation and Governance

### Animation Taxonomy

#### Naming Convention
- `{section}-{element}-{action}`
- Example: `hero-title-reveal`, `skills-bar-progress`

#### Classification System
- **Entrance**: Animations bringing elements into view
- **Exit**: Animations removing elements from view
- **State**: Animations between interactive states
- **Attention**: Animations drawing focus to elements
- **Background**: Ambient animations for atmosphere

### Implementation Guidelines

#### Code Structure
- Centralized animation constants (durations, easings)
- Reusable animation components/utilities
- Consistent implementation patterns
- Clear commenting for complex sequences

#### Quality Control
- Performance testing on target devices
- Accessibility compliance verification
- Cross-browser testing protocol
- Visual regression testing for animations
