## Technical Debt Management

### Planned Technical Debt
- Initial implementation with basic animations, enhance later
- Start with minimal responsive breakpoints, refine as needed
- Begin with essential accessibility features, expand coverage later
- Use placeholder content where final content is pending

### Debt Repayment Schedule
- Animation enhancements during Phase 4
- Expanded responsive refinements throughout Phase 3-4
- Accessibility audit and improvements in Phase 4
- Content finalization by end of Phase 3

## Quality Assurance Plan

### Visual Fidelity Testing
- Regular design reviews against specifications
- Visual regression testing for component library
- Pixel-perfect implementation validation
- Color and typography compliance checking
